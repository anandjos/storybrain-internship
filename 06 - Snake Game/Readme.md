# Snake Game

Create the age old snake game with controls to move around at the bottom.

# Notes

1. Apples should appear in random
2. Snake's length increases by one when it eats an apple
3. Hitting the boundary/hitting itself kills the snake
4. Add separate screen for scores with timestamp
5. Optimise for great user experience and playability
6. Think about ease of play
7. Design the entire application with end user in mind
8. Test in iOS & Android
