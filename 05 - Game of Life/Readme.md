# Conway's Game of Life

Implement a simplistic Game of Life implementation based on the rules as mentioned in [Wikipedia][w].

Pointers:

- Use P5.js for creating the scene
- Add start/pause/clear buttons at the bottom
- Add ability to click the cells to toggle state when the game is paused
- Find minimum click area for target devices and compute grid accordingly
- Do a edge to edge grid with row of buttons at the bottom
